# 🔥 Overview
NigeriaFakeNewsDetector is a cutting-edge, AI-powered solution designed specifically for the detection and prevention of fake news in Nigeria. Built using a fine-tuned aROBERTa model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and HuggingFace’s robust Trainer, this model outperforms conventional classifiers in recognizing misleading, deceptive, or dangerous news in both English and local Nigerian contexts.

✅ Why It’s Different
🇳🇬 Trained on Nigerian-specific datasets blended with global fake news sources.

⚙️ Fine-tuned with LoRA for lightweight and efficient deployment.

🤖 Built on HuggingFace Trainer, ensuring state-of-the-art performance and reproducibility.

🛡️ Informed by Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act (2015) and the Fake News (Prohibition) Bill to provide legal justification for every citizen to use this tool before forwarding any content.

📱 Highly extensible — can power mobile apps, chatbots, and browser extensions.

📌 Justification — Why Every Nigerian Must Use This Tool
Under Section 24 of the Nigerian Cybercrime Act, individuals can face prison sentences for spreading or even forwarding misleading content. Additionally, the Fake News Bill, though controversial, reinforces the government's stance against misinformation.

💡 Whether or not you're the originator, forwarding a fake message can land you in jail.
With this app, you can verify news instantly before sharing, protecting yourself, your community, and national unity.
This model is not just another NLP project — it's a public necessity, a digital guardian in the fight against misinformation in Africa’s largest democracy.
